The following is a menu of commands that you can enter in your terminal and their description:

COMMANDS:         DESCRIPTION:

You can also force quit the program with 'CTRL-c' at any time.

RE-SET DATABASE

If you would like to delete all of your database data and then repopulate it, first run the following two lines of code in 'rake console' in your terminal: 
    `User.delete_all`
    `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(‚ÄúDELETE from sqlite_sequence where name = 'users‚Äô‚Äù)`

Then, un-comment out lines 11-12 in the seeds.rb file and run rake db:seed again.
